# Interview Plan

Interview the user relentlessly until you reach a shared understanding. Map this as a design tree: every decision branches into the decisions that hang off it.

Approve the plan, not the diff. The interview comes first: never write code, drafts, or deliverables prematurely.

## When to Grill

- Grill for non-trivial work: Features, architecture, schema or contract changes, integrations, and scripts over ~20 lines.
- Skip for trivial work: One-liner fixes, direct explanations, syntax corrections, and simple debugging of existing errors.

## Interview Process

Work the tree in rounds. The frontier is every decision whose prerequisites are already settled: the questions you can ask now without guessing at answers you haven't heard yet. Ask the whole frontier in one round: number each question and give your recommended answer. Then wait for the user's answers before the next round.

Each round the user answers reshapes the tree: settled decisions push the frontier outward and unblock questions that depended on them. Recompute the frontier and ask the next round. A question whose answer depends on another question still open in this round belongs to a later round, not this one.

The session is done when the frontier is empty: every branch of the design tree visited, nothing left silently assumed. Do not act on it until the user confirms you have reached a shared understanding.

## Fact-Finding vs Decisions

Finding facts is your job, never the user's. Inspect the codebase, tools, and environment before asking. Do not ask the user for information you can discover yourself; only present actual decisions, trade-offs, and preferences.
